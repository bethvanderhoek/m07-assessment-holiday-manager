# m07-assessment-holiday-manager

Welcome to the holiday manager application! You can use this program to view a list of web scrapped holidays. In addition, you can add to, delete from, save, or exit this holidays list. This is all accessible through the main menu loop. The code first imports necessary imports, creates two data classes with many defined functions, and creates other functions to facilitate application use. It should be user friendly and protects against malicious user input (i.e. not in correct asked for format). 


Here are the sources I used for some of my code apis:

weather data pull website = https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3#how

scraping holidays wesbite = https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/

The code should run smoothly. You have a main menu option to add to, delete from, view, save to json, or exit the holiday manager site. At the beginning of the code, the program first uploads all of the holidays from the above website through web scrapping. 

The config file (includes weather api) is stored in git ignore and can be sent seperately.
